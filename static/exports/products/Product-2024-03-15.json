The universal wingtip design was put to the ultimate test by athletes of all kinds so you can trust these earbuds will stay put through work days and workouts. Complete with pressure relieving vents, you can comfortably wear these earbuds all day long.Three soft silicone eartip options make it easy to find the right size. The Fit Test1 setup for both Apple and Android helps ensure proper fit for a customized acoustic seal and optimal performance.</p>\r\n<p>Surrounds You in SoundBeats Fit Pro is engineered to deliver powerful, balanced sound via a custom acoustic platform that stays with you through your daily activities. A proprietary, dual-element diaphragm driver resides within a two-chamber housing, resulting in clear sound with outstanding stereo separation. An advanced digital processor then optimizes audio performance for loudness and clarity, while simultaneously ensuring clean noise-cancellation.Beats Fit Pro supports Spatial Audio with dynamic head tracking for immersive music, movies, and games. Dynamic head tracking uses gyroscopes and accelerometers to adjust the sound as you turn your head, for a multi-dimensional experience that makes you feel like you’re inside of it.</p>\r\n<p>Hear What MattersWith two distinct listening modes, you are in control of what you hear. Fully adaptive Active Noise Cancelling (ANC) uses real-time audio calibration to continuously pinpoint unwanted external sounds and optimize sound output. When you need to be aware of your surroundings, easily switch to Transparency mode. The external-facing microphones capture environmental and ambient sound around you to mix in with your music. Now, you can always choose the listening mode that fits your needs.</p>\r\n<p>Equipped with Apple H1 Powered by the Apple H1 chip, Beats Fit Pro is ready to help you handle whatever the day throws at you. Instantly one-touch pair with all your Apple devices. When you switch from your iPhone to your Mac or iPad, Automatic Switching re-routes your audio. Audio Sharing with another pair of Beats headphones (or Apple AirPods) means you can easily share your favorite music with all of your friends.</p>\r\n<p>Power Your DayThe earbuds have up to 6 hours of listening time6with 18 additional hours provided by its pocket-sized charging case7. That means that Beats Fit Pro gives you up to 24 hours of combined playback. With ANC or Transparency mode turned off, you’ll get up to 7 hours of listening time. If you need a little extra juice, 5-minute Fast Fuel charging gives up to 1 hour of playback8 when battery is low. A battery that lasts? That’s a power move.</p>\r\n<p>Loud and ClearWith a built-in accelerometer and Class 1 Bluetooth® technology, Beats Fit Pro can detect when you’re speaking to help you sound your best. Dual beamforming microphones pinpoint your voice while a digital processor cuts out external noise and wind, so your voice is clear and easy to hear.</p>\r\n<p>Works with AndroidBeats Fit Pro easily connects to Android devices via Bluetooth® right out of the box. With the Beats app for Android, you’ll get enhanced features like one-touch pairing, customized controls, battery levels, firmware updates, and a Fit Test to help you get the best sound and fit out of your earbuds.</p>",

Leveraging SVS's audio passion and expertise, these speakers exceed everything you might expect from such a small and versatile system, providing a truly world-class listening experience. No compromise. Paired with the acclaimed SB-1000 subwoofer and its 300 watts of power, this system delivers a complete multi-channel experience for movies and music. Prime Speakers: Extreme Performance and Uncompromised Fidelity Prime Satellite - Satellites Redefined: High-End Audio Gets Small From the moment you feel the weight of the Prime Satellite Speaker, it becomes clear that no other speaker has ever offered this level of audiophile design, high-end components, and precise build quality. Jets thunder through the sky. Bullets graze your ears. Prime Satellites simply outclass the tiny and tinny surround speakers designed to be more form than performer. Prime Satellites revolutionize surround speakers in fact, they employ many of the same components as their bigger brothers in the Prime and Ultra lines. Strategically placed, Prime Satellites create awe-inspiring realism and seamless sonic transitions from front- to-back and side-to-side. When the lights dim and the score fades in, they flood your room with dynamic audio realism and action. Painstakingly voiced and sonically matched, Prime Satellites are designed to blend with SVS towers, bookshelves, or in a system all their own for endless listening possibilities. SB-1000 Subwoofer: Impressive, Deep, Clean SVS-Bass in an Inconspicuous 13\" Cabinet Like a stick of dynamite, the SB-1000 is easy to conceal but its impact hard to ignore. Its the most SVS-bass that can be condensed into a 13 package. Pumping out loads of fast, clean, bottom end action-scene punches hit you right in the gut. When its time to party, your music comes to lifebass lines are tight and drum beats never muddy. Elegantly finished in premium black ash, gloss piano black, or gloss piano white, it fits with any décor. And yet, its small enough to tuck in a corner, if you need to keep it out of the way. Maximize the slam and impact of your home theater with a minimal footprint. SoundMatch Crossover Intelligently Designed for Your Listening Room SVS's exclusive SoundMatch crossover sports premium-grade capacitors, air-core inductors, and heavy-trace printed circuit boards. All of these high-quality components yield lower distortion, tighter tolerances, better heat dissipation, and all around better sound. The 2-way crossover is uniquely tuned so each driver can blend perfectly each other while offering the best on and off-axis response, while maintaining phase coherency and razor sharp time domain behavior.

May not include all parts and accessories. Comes in non-original packaging with a data cable.iPhone 12 has it all. 5G on iPhone is super fast, so you can download movies on the fly and stream high-quality video. You can do it in more places, because iPhone 12 has the broadest 5G coverage worldwide. OLED delivers brighter brights, darker blacks, and higher resolution for everything you look at. Both the Wide and Ultra Wide cameras now have Night mode to capture incredible low-light shots. Night mode senses when light is low and kicks in automatically, maintaining clarity while capturing beautiful vibrant color. All you have to do is start snapping. Deep Fusion, in mid to low light, analyzes multiple exposures to maximize detail. Check out the texture in the wood, fabric, and crystal. And the Ultra Wide gets you a heroic perspective. Smart HDR 3 balances the elements in a shot, bringing out detail in the subject and trees while retaining the rich color of the sky — even at high noon. Beyond faces, Smart HDR 3 uses machine learning to recognize scenes, then adjusts sharpness, color, and white balance where needed. Even in bright light, Smart HDR 3 is amazing at capturing texture, skin tone, color saturation, and individual details that make photos feel TRUE to life. Portrait mode artfully blurs the background to put all the focus on your subject. Then there’s Night mode Time-lapse. Just prop up your iPhone and let the light trails begin. Now you can record 4K HDR video with Dolby Vision; edit in Photos or iMovie. Then zap it to your TV using AirPlay to see all that color and detail. It’s a start-to-finish cinematic experience. iOS 14 is packed with shortcuts that get you just what you want, right when you want it. iPhone is designed to protect your information. Face ID data doesn’t leave your iPhone and is never backed up to iCloud or anywhere else. iOS shows you an app’s privacy practices before you download it. When you use Apple Pay, your card number isn’t shared with merchants. And the list goes on. To charge your new iPhone, you can continue to use your USB‑A to Lightning cable. Or you can take advantage of fast charging with the USB‑C to Lightning cable now included in the box, which works with existing USB‑C power adapters and computer ports.</p>",

And iPhone Xs Max makes it massive, with a screen that measure 6.5 inches - our largest display ever on an iPhone. Custom-built OLED. The OLED panels in iPhone Xs Max allow for an HDR display with the industry's best color accuracy, true blacks, and remarkable brightness and contrast. They're the sharpest displays, with the highest pixel density, on any Apple device. A new level of water resistance. The most durable glass in a smartphone, sealed and precision-fitted with surgical-grade stainless steel band, helps create a more water-resistant enclosure - up to 2 meters for 30 minutes. iPhone Xs Max even resists spills from Coffee, Tea, Soda, and more. The A12 Bionic, with our next-generation Neural Engine, delivers incredible performance. It uses real-time machine learning to transform the way you experience photos, gaming, augmented reality, and more. Sensors, processors, algorithms, and you. An innovative dual-camera system integrates the ISP, the Neural Engine, and advanced algorithms to unlock new creative possibilities and help you capture incredible photos. A picture is worth a trillion operations. The iPhone Xs dual-camera system harnesses the unprecedented power of the Neural Engine and its ability to perform five trillion operations per second. Together with the Apple-designed ISP, it works like the world's fastest photographer's assistant to help turn your pictures into showstoppers. Security made simple. Face ID reinvente the way we unlock, log in, and pay. Some of our most sophisticated technologies - the TrueDepth camera system, the Secure Enclave, and the Neural Engine - make it the most secure facial authentication ever in a smartphone. And even faster and easier to use.</p>",

Pre-owned phones are inspected, cleaned, and wiped free of any previous owner’s data to ensure like new quality. They are verified to function properly with some cosmetic blemishes. Comes in non-original packaging with a data cable (cube not included) and SIM ejection pin. A transformative triple‑camera system that adds tons of capability without complexity. An unprecedented leap in battery life. And a mind‑blowing chip that doubles down on machine learning and pushes the boundaries of what a smartphone can do. Welcome to the first iPhone powerful enough to be called Pro. Expanded field of view. iPhone 11 Pro Max lets you zoom from the Telephoto all the way out to the new Ultra Wide camera, for an impressive 4x optical zoom range. Elegant, immersive interface. We leveraged the wider field of view to let you see what’s happening outside the image frame — and simply tap to capture it. And there’s almost nothing between you and your subject except a new, Pro camera font. So you’re always fully immersed in the scene. iPhone 11 Pro Max lets you capture videos that are beautifully true to life, with greater detail and smoother motion. Epic processing power means it can shoot 4K video with extended dynamic range and cinematic video stabilization — all at 60 fps. You get more creative control, too, with four times more scene and powerful new editing tools to play with. From dimly lit restaurants to moonlit beaches, the new Night mode uses intelligent software and A13 Bionic to deliver low‑light shots never before possible on iPhone. And it all happens automatically. You can also experiment with manual controls to dial in even more detail and less noise. From dimly lit restaurants to moonlit beaches, the new Night mode uses intelligent software and A13 Bionic to deliver low‑light shots never before possible on iPhone. And it all happens automatically. You can also experiment with manual controls to dial in even more detail and less noise. Next-generation Smart HDR uses advanced algorithms to finesse highlight and shadow detail in your image. And now it leverages machine learning to recognize faces in your shot and intelligently relight them. That means iPhone 11 Pro Max can automatically fine-tune detail in both the subject and the background. Even some DSLR cameras can’t do that. Say you’re taking photos and you see something you’ve got to catch on video. With QuickTake, there’s no need to switch modes. Just leave your finger on the shutter to start recording. Want to keep the recording going? Swipe right. To take burst photos, swipe left. The new 12MP TrueDepth camera lets you take superfun slow-motion selfie videos at 120 fps, or shoot in 4K at 60 fps. For stills, the camera now automatically zooms out when you rotate your iPhone, so you can get your whole crew in the shot. Yes, even selfies can be Pro. The Super Retina XDR display boasts not one but two new record levels of brightness and understands when to use them. It hits up to 800 nits when you’re out in the sun — great for shooting and making selects on the go — and up to 1200 nits when you’re viewing extreme dynamic range content. It’s like having a Pro Display XDR on your iPhone. We custom‑built A13 Bionic with a focus on machine learning across the entire chip — enabling experiences that simply aren’t found on any other smartphone. In fact, it’s so fast, so powerful, and so intelligent, it’s years ahead of any other chip. Which gives you an unfair advantage. IP68 rating water resistant to a depth of 4 meters for up to 30 minutes. Spill resistant for common liquids like coffee, tea, and soda. Dust resistant thanks to precision‑fitted seals. Face ID is now up to 30 percent faster. It works from farther away. At more angles, too. And it’s still the most secure facial authentication in a smartphone. Privacy is built in, everything about iPhone is engineered to protect your privacy. Face ID data doesn’t leave your iPhone and is never backed up to iCloud or anywhere else. Maps tells you where you’re going without telling anyone where you are. Every iMessage you send is encrypted end‑to‑end. And the list goes on.</p>",
