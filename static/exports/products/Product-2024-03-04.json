The universal wingtip design was put to the ultimate test by athletes of all kinds so you can trust these earbuds will stay put through work days and workouts. Complete with pressure relieving vents, you can comfortably wear these earbuds all day long.Three soft silicone eartip options make it easy to find the right size. The Fit Test1 setup for both Apple and Android helps ensure proper fit for a customized acoustic seal and optimal performance.</p>\r\n<p>Surrounds You in SoundBeats Fit Pro is engineered to deliver powerful, balanced sound via a custom acoustic platform that stays with you through your daily activities. A proprietary, dual-element diaphragm driver resides within a two-chamber housing, resulting in clear sound with outstanding stereo separation. An advanced digital processor then optimizes audio performance for loudness and clarity, while simultaneously ensuring clean noise-cancellation.Beats Fit Pro supports Spatial Audio with dynamic head tracking for immersive music, movies, and games. Dynamic head tracking uses gyroscopes and accelerometers to adjust the sound as you turn your head, for a multi-dimensional experience that makes you feel like you’re inside of it.</p>\r\n<p>Hear What MattersWith two distinct listening modes, you are in control of what you hear. Fully adaptive Active Noise Cancelling (ANC) uses real-time audio calibration to continuously pinpoint unwanted external sounds and optimize sound output. When you need to be aware of your surroundings, easily switch to Transparency mode. The external-facing microphones capture environmental and ambient sound around you to mix in with your music. Now, you can always choose the listening mode that fits your needs.</p>\r\n<p>Equipped with Apple H1 Powered by the Apple H1 chip, Beats Fit Pro is ready to help you handle whatever the day throws at you. Instantly one-touch pair with all your Apple devices. When you switch from your iPhone to your Mac or iPad, Automatic Switching re-routes your audio. Audio Sharing with another pair of Beats headphones (or Apple AirPods) means you can easily share your favorite music with all of your friends.</p>\r\n<p>Power Your DayThe earbuds have up to 6 hours of listening time6with 18 additional hours provided by its pocket-sized charging case7. That means that Beats Fit Pro gives you up to 24 hours of combined playback. With ANC or Transparency mode turned off, you’ll get up to 7 hours of listening time. If you need a little extra juice, 5-minute Fast Fuel charging gives up to 1 hour of playback8 when battery is low. A battery that lasts? That’s a power move.</p>\r\n<p>Loud and ClearWith a built-in accelerometer and Class 1 Bluetooth® technology, Beats Fit Pro can detect when you’re speaking to help you sound your best. Dual beamforming microphones pinpoint your voice while a digital processor cuts out external noise and wind, so your voice is clear and easy to hear.</p>\r\n<p>Works with AndroidBeats Fit Pro easily connects to Android devices via Bluetooth® right out of the box. With the Beats app for Android, you’ll get enhanced features like one-touch pairing, customized controls, battery levels, firmware updates, and a Fit Test to help you get the best sound and fit out of your earbuds.</p>",
